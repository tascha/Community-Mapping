## Learn About Your Community Assets {#learn-about-your-community-assets}

This section discusses learning about individuals, associations, and institutions in your community.

### Learning about individuals {#learning-about-individuals}

>“Each time a person uses his or her capacity, the community is stronger and the person more powerful. That is why strong communities are basically places where the capacities of local residents are identified, valued, and used.” <br/> -- Kretzmann, J. P., &amp; McKnight, J. L. (1993). Building from the inside out: A path toward finding and mobilizing a community’s assets. Chicago, IL: ACTA Publications. P. 13.

The most foundational assets of a community are the individuals that form it. Every individual has gifts that they can share with their community -- like knowledge, a skill, or physical space, to name just a few.

*   Members of this category can be specific people, but can also be demographic groups: for instance, young parents, high school students, or seniors.
*   If you encounter individuals who want to work with the library but aren’t sure how they can help, completing a skills and interests inventory can help.
*   You can use the 4H approach in interviews, focus groups, or community meetings to help individuals identify their “gifts.” The four H’s are:
    *   Head - knowledge that can be shared.
    *   Heart - passions and values.
    *   Hands - skills that can be taught to others, or that can help others.
    *   Home - communities that you are a part of.
    *   See Ryan &amp; Bourke, 2008, pp. 182 - 189 for more details and worksheets.
*   When you’re focusing on individuals as assets, your goal will be to help each individual contribute to the community or the library. This is different than if you are talking to individuals to help create a portrait of your community (don’t use the capacity inventory for this). You should avoid making individuals feel “used” or “studied” (Kretzmann &amp; McKnight, 1993, p.17).
*   **Youth.** As youth librarians, you are more likely than many people to recognize that youth have gifts and capacities to help their communities. Teens may know their communities as well as or better than adults, bring fresh ideas and perspectives to the table, and have connections to schools, families, and other teens. Youth may be seen as more credible than adults to their peers.[^1] _Building Communities from the Inside Out_ provides many suggestions as to how youth can build productive connections with associations, organizations, and other individuals (Chapter 1, pages 33-44).
*   **Seniors.** Instead of being merely “the elderly,” seniors can be tremendous library assets with their experience and knowledge of cultural and community history. Many retirees have skills they are happy to share with teens; others can help connect the library to associations and organizations they are or were involved with.
*   **Marginalized groups.** Don’t write off groups that are traditionally thought of as only having needs, not assets, like people with disabilities or people from a lower SES. Everyone is an asset the library could potentially work with.

<div class="table-format sidebar"><span class="title"><h5>DO ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE CAPACITIES?</h5></span>
<p>Kretzmann & McKnight argue that need-focused labels, like “ex-convict”, “elderly,” “illiterate”, and “gang member” reflect and reinforce society’s belief that these “needy” people are “empty” and without anything to contribute to their community. Asset-based development means looking past labels to each individual’s specific gifts.</p>
<p><i>For example, “She is a pregnant teenager. She needs counseling, therapy, residential services, special education.” But also, “She is Mary Smith. She has a miraculously beautiful voice. We need her in the choir. She needs a record producer.” Her label, pregnant teenager, tells of emptiness and calls forth rejection, isolation and treatment. Her name, Mary Smith, tells of her gifts and evokes community and contributions.</i></p>

### Associations {#associations}

Associations are groups of community members who gather together voluntarily around a common interest or goal. Associations are key to getting the community involved in your teen services.

*   Since associations are already formed around an interest, topic, or area, their potential contributions can be easier to identify. They may have expertise, equipment or other specialized resources to share. They can also be a source of donations or facilities.
*   Associations may already have outreach programs or services for the community that can be modified for use with your teens.
*   Find out what the association’s goals and mission are. This can help you find ways that getting involved with the library will help the association.
*   The smaller and more informal an association is, the less documented it will be. As you are talking to individuals, ask them what kinds of associations they belong to or know of.

#### Types of Associations
Kretzmann & McKnight have identified many different types of associations, including:

| Artistic organizations<br/>Business organizations<br/>Charitable groups &amp; drives <br/>Church groups<br/>Civic event planning committees<br/>Community support groups<br/>Senior groups</br>Health &amp; fitness groups</br>Interest and hobbyist clubs</br>Local media (neighborhood newsletter, etc.)|Neighborhood groups<br/>Outdoor groups</br>Political organizations<br/>School groups<br/>Self-help groups<br/>Service clubs<br/>Sports leagues<br/>Study groups<br/>Veteran groups |

### Institutions {#institutions}

Institutions (as defined by ABCD) are groups of people brought together professionally -- such as business, schools, government agencies. They often have many resources that can be shared with the community.

*   Even more than associations, institutions are likely to have outreach programs at the ready for the community.
*   Institutions are also more likely to have space or money to help your teen services.
*   An institution’s hiring practices can be one of its assets.[^2]

### Methods for learning more {#methods-for-learning-more}

Depending on your situation, you can use surveys or focus groups to learn more about your community’s assets. You can also use the methods described in the Capacity module (interviews and town halls), or any combination of methods.

* **Surveys.** Surveys are a good option for getting succinct information from a large number of people, especially quantitative information. The response rate is often low, however, and you may not always be able to follow-up with respondents to get a better understanding of their responses.For people who are not literate and people who primarily speak other languages, you may need to conduct in-person interviews or provide the survey in multiple languages.[^3] Surveys can be conducted face-to-face, online, by mail, by phone, or on paper that is distributed in the library or at library events.[^4]  
* **Focus groups.** Focus groups allow you to guide the discussion around a specific question. It is important to have a diverse set of participants so that you don’t just hear one perspective. Focus groups may be cheaper and/or less time-consuming than extensive surveys (depending on how they are administered), and can provide deeper insights. However, you cannot hear from as many people in a focus group.

In addition, consider the following sources when you are identifying assets:

*   **Directories** like the yellow pages, or a list of local businesses from your Chamber of Commerce.[^5]  
*   Your **local newspaper** or community newsletter, along with community bulletin boards in coffeehouses, community centers and other gathering places.[^6]
*   **Existing networks**--do you already have partners that can help you identify assets and reach out to contacts? You can also try making new connections to ask for help--civic associations, clubs and coalitions, etc.
*   **Other Community Institutions** like hospitals, churches, and parks and recreation facilities.

<div class="table-format orange">For a small project, focus on pre-existing resources (directories, databases). For more in-depth information, focus on people who are easy to reach out to (patrons, partners) or who are key community members.</div>
