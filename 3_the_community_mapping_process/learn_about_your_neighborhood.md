A guiding principle of ABCD is to keep “citizens” at the center, listening instead of telling, asking questions instead of delivering answers.[^1] Throughout this process, remember who you are doing this for, and keep teens at the center.

### Who are the people in your neighborhood? {#who-are-the-people-in-your-neighborhood}

The first step is to gain an accurate picture of the people that make up your community. Where are they from? Where do they live now? What languages do they speak? What is their socioeconomic status? Your library, or another local organization like the chamber of commerce, may already have a lot of this information packaged. See if there is previous work that you can leverage. Keep in mind that it might not be as up-to-date or comprehensive as you would like.

Are there groups that are not currently at the table with you as you plan programs for your teens?
