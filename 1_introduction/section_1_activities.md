### 1A. Community mapping KWL {#1a-community-mapping-kwl}

Complete this worksheet by first describing your experience (if any) with community mapping. Then create a list of what you already know (the K in KWL) about community mapping. In the second column, write down what you want (W) to learn in this module. Youâ€™ll fill out the last column, what you learned (L) when you have completed this module.

### 1B. Share with the class {#1b-share-with-the-class}

On the discussion board, introduce yourself to the group. Include the description of your experience with community mapping, the list of things you know, and the list of things you want to learn that you created in Activity 1A.

### 1C. Implement {#1c-implement}

What kind of data do you already have access to? Find out what community mapping-related work has been done at your library before. Start thinking with an asset-based approach by recording at least one community asset in each category (more if you can think of them!) that your library is currently connected to or working with in some way.
