|Connected Learning Principles|How Community Mapping Helps|
|---|
| **Building Pathways<br/>Production-Centered** | Community mapping can reveal assets to add to the network of resources you help teens connect to. |
| **Opportunity<br/>Interests<br/>Sponsorship** | Community mapping can tell you what opportunities teens would like to have and help you find support for those opportunities and others. |
| **Shared Purpose** | Engaging the entire community in the development of teens develops a sense of shared purpose and lets the teens know they are valued. |
| **Relationships** | Community mapping can help you identify groups of teens who aren’t being reached by the library. |
