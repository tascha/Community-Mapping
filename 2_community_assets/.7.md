Read [**A Story of Two Communities**](https://sustainingcommunity.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/community-a-and-communityb/). How has your library approached your community in the past—by focusing on needs or by focusing on assets?

### 2B. Potential assets {#2b-potential-assets}

Create a second mini-asset map with assets your library _could_ connect with, but hasn’t yet. Add any helpful connections that might already exist.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Individuals** |  |  |
| **Associations** |  |  |
