## Asset-Based Community Development {#asset-based-community-development}

The asset-based community development (ABCD) model of community development, developed by John Kretzmann and John McKnight, focuses on the strengths of a community, rather than its weaknesses, as is often typical in community development efforts. ABCD identifies five types of assets: individuals, associations (groups of individuals), institutions (formal and professional groups of people like government agencies), physical resources (like land or money), and — most importantly — connections (relationships between assets).

<a href="http://www.nurturedevelopment.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Asset-Mapping-CCAMP_System_Handbook.pdf">Ryan & Bourke (2008, p114)</a> set forth the following guiding principles for an asset-based community development effort. 
<ol><li>Begin with the end in mind.</li><li>Build relationships. </li><li>Build on existing resources. </li><li>Commit to sustainability. </li><li>Start small and place-based. </li><li>Lead by stepping back. </li><li>Support inclusiveness and participation. </li><li>Support mutually beneficial problem solving and goal setting. </li><li>Work to sustain a learning community environment. </li><li>Connect people through stories. </li></ol>

### Types of Community Assets

* **Individuals.** The most foundational assets of a community are the individuals that form it. Every individual has gifts that they can share with their community -- like knowledge, a skill, or physical space, to name just a few.
* **Associations.** Associations are groups of community members who gather together voluntarily around a common interest. Associations are key to getting the community involved in your teen services. 
* **Institutions..** Institutions are groups of people brought together professionally -- such as business, schools, government agencies. They often have many resources that can be shared with the community. 
* **Physical Assets.** Individuals, associations, and institutions can all provide gifts in the form of physical assets, like land, buildings, equipment, and money.
* **Connections.** Connections are the relationships between the other types of assets. Creating new connections between community assets can greatly increase the opportunities for connected learning in your library. You can think of connections as an expression of social capital.[^2]

<div class="table-format sidebar"><span class="title"><h5>STONE SOUP</h5></span>
<p>Ryan and Bourke (2008, p143) compare community assets to the ingredients of a “stone soup.” In isolation, an individual or organization might not think their “gifts” amount to much. But in combination, an entire community working together can produce something greater than the sum of its parts.
